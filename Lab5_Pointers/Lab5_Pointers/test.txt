Hi Bob, I just finished our overview for the new paint job on Timberlake Road. The house
has five total rooms that they are looking to have painted, with the following
dimensions: twenty-five square feet for the first bedroom, twenty-seven square feet for
the second, fifteen square feet for the bathroom, thirty-one square feet for the kitchen,
and forty square feet for the living room. Can you have Sarah create me a quote for the
client and send it over to them? I think they will be ready to sign off today! Thanks.
